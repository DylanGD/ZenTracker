- Webserver
- PHP 5.3
- No database server needed for tests (sqlite db built-in)
- Compatible with MySQL/MSSQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle...
- Memcache or APC recommanded in production

**Deployment**

**Only /web folder must be readed by the webserver**. Don't upload the whole ZenTracker in a folder readable by webserver.

On a shared hosting, put all files in the root folder (/) and put /web contents in /public_html for instance.
